    <p>
      Following Inter Miami's last match on Monday, Lionel Messi felt
      discomfort. After attempting to participate in training, he had an MRI.
      Based on the results and the priority of having Messi healthy for the
      start of the MLS season later this month, the club chose to take the
      precaution of leaving him out of today's squad entirely. As head coach
      Tata Martino has said, the players' fitness is a big concern at the
      moment, especially after Facundo Farias' season-ending ACL injury.
